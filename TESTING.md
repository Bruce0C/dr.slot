## Code Validation

### HTML


I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Responsiveness

I've tested my deployed project to check for responsiveness issues.

| Page | Mobile | Tablet | Desktop | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Register | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/mobile-register.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/tablet-register.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/desktop-register.png) | Works as expected |
| Login | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/mobile-login.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/tablet-login.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/desktop-login.png) | Works as expected |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/mobile-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/tablet-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/desktop-home.png) | Works as expected |
| 404 | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/mobile-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/tablet-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/desktop-404.png) | Works as expected |

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Page | Chrome | Safari | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Register | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome-register.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox-register.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/safari-register.png) | Works as expected |
| Login | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome-login.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox-login.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/safari-login.png) | Works as expected |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/safari-home.png) | Works as expected |

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

| Page | Mobile | Desktop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Register | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-register.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-register.png) |
| Login | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-login.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-login.png) |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-home.png) |
| 404 | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-404.png) |

## Defensive Programming
Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:
